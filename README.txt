Display your travels on customizable maps !

Easily add geographical tags on a map when you write a post, and it will automatically create new countries and localities terms. You can also order those locations randomly or by date to define your routes.

Use the map as a widget, and pick your own colors to customize it. It is a SVG map that react to users actions (mouse over posts and terms links, click on route line...).
